# revProjectZero
Project 0 will be a basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application incorporating database connectivity with JDBC, and Javalin-based RESTful endpoints consumed by HTTP Requests via Postman.

MVP for this application will include functionality for at least one of each CRUD operation, and the demonstration of 5 passing unit tests or 5 working logs.â€Œ

The theme of the application is your choice! Have fun with it, just try to pick something that plays well with a database. Banking apps, gatcha games, and employee/inventory management systems are three ideas that tend to work well.
